 Run ``` phonebook-manager-cs.sln ``` to get started.

Included the basic functionalities like create, search, update and delete. 

The app has a simple UI but improvable UX. Will be working on reducing the number of windows in the software and improving the UX in the following releases.

## Software requirements:
1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later with necessary components installed to create Windows Forms App using Visual C#.

2. Oracle 10g DBMS configure with the username as ``` phonebook ``` and password ```password123```. Create a table called ``` Contacts ```. If this approach is cumbersome, you are free to change the source code as you please to fit your requirements. Keep in mind that this is a GPL software, so your code also has to be GPL licensed.

As of now, the app is designed for a single user and hence, doesn't have login functionalities. Secondly, the contacts stored in the contacts are uniquely identifies by a ``` userId ```, which means that they are not stored in alphabetical order. I'll try to improve this in the future releases.

I have tried my best to simplify the navigation of my software and its source code. If there's anything you can improve or if there's code that can be refactored, do open a pull request.
